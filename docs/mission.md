Newsroom in a Box encompasses the open source activities of [Philadelphia Publishing Company](https://phillypublishing.com).

Through our open source work, we aim to fulfill the following mission:

This mission was borne out of the following theory of change:

<center>
> By making it easier to start, scale, and operate independent digital news outlets,
> we will encourage new independent publishers
> as well as helping already-established publishers
> secure and expand their operations.
